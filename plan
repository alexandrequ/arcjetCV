GUI work
    postprocess tab operational
        plots and text
        output formats
    iterate processing tab design
        grayscale + HSV + ML
        decide on user playback controls (frame/video)
    
ML more robust/faster
    find error frames and add to training set
    retrain on full set using HSV input
    spallation tracking as 4th class
    try running on Pleides/GPU machines

Frame analysis
    Camera Calibration - input multiple images of chessboard, return camera params
    
    Pose estimation
        attach calibration checkerboard to arms
        find pattern in frames
        
    Feature tracking
        line tracking
        sting edge tracking
        particle tracking
