Frame analysis

    Camera Calibration - input multiple images of chessboard, return camera params
    Image Normalization 
        rescale to 255? 1?
        smoothing/denoising
        calibration
        grayscale representation
    
    Finding ROI
        use thresholding
        find largest body location, bounding box, centerline
    
    Pose estimation
        attach calibration checkerboard to arms
        find pattern in frames
    
    Edge extraction algorithms - should use multiple techniques
        Measure color/intensity gradients along centerline
        Identify which gradient parameters are most effective
        
Video analysis
    sting tracking
    edge tracking
    particle tracking
